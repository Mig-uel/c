## Chapter 1: What is C programming?

- The C Program you write is called the source code.
- The source code is saved in a file with a .c extension.
- A compiler is a program that translates the source code into machine code.
- Computers are made up of nothing more than a series of switches that can be turned on or off.
- Computers must be given instructions in binary code.
- The prefix bi- means two and the two states of electricity are called binary states.

- An error in a program is called a bug.
- The process of finding and fixing errors is called debugging.
